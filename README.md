# Multiple Daily Notes

Inspired by [Templated daily notes](https://github.com/digitorum/obsidian-templayted-daily-notes).

Multiple daily notes replicates much of the built in daily notes plugin behaviour but extends it by allowing multiple daily notes to be configured simultaneously.

Works on desktop and mobile, with support for commands and hotkeys.
